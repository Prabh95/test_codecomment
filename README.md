# Project Teamwork Contract DSCI 532

### Expectations

Group members are expected to work on DSCI 532 for about **4 - 8 hours a week**. In this time, group members should complete their assigned work, and help support others or review GitHub issues and reports. Group members should be notified if someone is unable to complete their work in the assigned time or expects to not finish by the agreed upon deadline (**Friday 11:59 pm** every week).

### Meetings

- Every Tuesday during DSCI 532 Lab sessions (in person)
- On Friday before the submission deadline we may have an optional meeting at **1 PM** (remote)
    - Purpose of meeting: To check in on progress
- Debugging sessions (remote, when necessary)

### Communication

GitHub Issues (main) and Slack will be the platforms used for general small talk and discussion. We expect all communications to be kind and clear. All issues should be brought up to the group and resolved amicably. No personal insults should be made.

### Review Process

- Submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com.
- Add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by at least another teammate.
    - This will be reinforced using a GitHub rule.
- Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

### Roles

These are the main responsibilities which should be collectively covered by the group throughout all milestones for this project:

1. **Project Manager**
    - Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding them as GitHub issues.
    - GitHub issues should also be added to GitHub milestones starting from Week 2.
    - Responsible for sharing all notes and in-class activities with teammates. Noting all action items needed to be completed.
    - Responsible for writing and/or checking the documentation for the functions in the package.

2. **Proofreader**
    - Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.

3. **Developer**
    - Responsible for developing the functionalities of the dashboard.
    - Responsible for developing tests.

### Style of Work

Our group prefers to work mainly remotely, with in-person meetings during lab sessions. We prefer to restrict work to weekdays and have committed to finishing our work at least one day before the deadline. Work should be distributed evenly among group members every week, and most of the work will be completed individually. That said, if any issues or bugs arise, the group will work collaboratively to debug and resolve the issues, with optional remote meetings if necessary.

We will be using Dash in Python.

### Deadline

All work must be completed and pushed and ready to be merged to the main branch by **Friday 11:59 PM** every week. The proof-reader will review the work at the pre-deadline meeting and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

### Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

1. On the first offence, a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. On the second offence, a meeting will be called to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
3. On the third offence, the group will reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues faced with the teammate.

_Note: For Week 3, the deadline will be amended to Saturday 11:59 pm (the night before the deadline), and the meeting will take place on Saturday at 1 pm._
